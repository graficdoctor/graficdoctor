### Hi there ðŸ‘‹   
### After years of working as a graphic designer, it's time to move back to what I liked the most as a 12 year-old: coding. I barely remember what the language was I learned at school (BASIC), but it was still the earlier days of computing.
I was always drawn to the flickering screen, but somehow ended up working for print. Now I'm moving back to the screen. I'm training to become a full stack developer. Or maybe I will even become a JavaScript-head. I don't really know yet where the learning will take me. But thus far, totally enjoying the journey.
